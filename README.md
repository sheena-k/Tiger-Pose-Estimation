# Tiger-Pose-Estimation

## **Project Overview**

This project showcases the application of deep learning in pose estimation for tigers using the Ultralytics YOLO-Pose model. The goal is to detect and analyze tiger body keypoints, which can be used in wildlife monitoring, behavior analysis, and conservation.

**Setting Up Colab Environment**
  
  ##### Ensure Colab notebook is configured to use GPU for faster processing.


**Data Structure:**

Images: Annotated tiger images.

Annotations: 12 keypoints per tiger (head, legs, tail, etc.)


The YOLO-Pose model is typically trained for human pose estimation, so to get accurate results for tiger pose estimation,need to retrain or fine-tune the model using the Tiger-Pose dataset.

### YOLO-Pose for tiger pose estimation  
#### Transfer learning Approach

**Model Training**

The YOLO-Pose architecture modifies the standard YOLO object detection framework to output keypoint coordinates (x, y) instead of just bounding boxes.

Instead of classifying entire objects, the model predicts each keypointâ€™s exact position within the bounding box.

It minimizes errors by optimizing the Euclidean distance between predicted and ground truth keypoints.
